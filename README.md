=================

Layer swapper widget for David Spriggs CMV 

Widget designed to allow swapping of a configurable list of layers.  Most obvious use case is flipping thru historical imagery.  Works best for layers
which should be mutually exclusive of each other.  Also allows fading of the selected layer via a slider control.

Please visit the Wiki How-to page for configuring this widget in the CMV.
